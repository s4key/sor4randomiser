Streets of Rage 4 - Character Randomiser

This was a small project I put together to select a random character and randomise that characters moves for survival mode in Streets of Rage 4. Written in python using tkinter for the GUI.

This has been done as a hobby. I am still learning how to code so things are probably messy and inefficient. I will try to improve this as I get better.

The .json file has all the characters and their moves set in it. 

When the program is open, just click the randomise button. It's that easy.

I have build the application to a Windows binary using pyinstall. If you download the .exe file you will also need the .json file.

so4randomiser.zip has the binary and the .json file.
