Streets of Rage 4 - Character Randomiser

This was a small project I put together to select a random character and randomise that characters moves for survival mode in Streets of Rage 4. Written in python using tkinter for the GUI.

The .json file has all the characters and their moves set in it. 

When the program is open, just click the randomise button. It's that easy.

Future thoughts:

Possibly graphical representation of the characters.
